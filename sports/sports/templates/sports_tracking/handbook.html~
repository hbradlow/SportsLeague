     <p>A. An eligible participant of IFC sports must be eligible to the policies of Campus Recreation<br><br> 
<b>Make Note: Players may not participate in two or more teams in any division and in the same sport during the 
Intramural season. Players may however play in a co-ed league or in a men’s/women’s league at the same time. 
IFC is considered a men’s competitive division and therefore will follow the same guidelines as described earlier. 
Participants who are in violation of this policy shall be banned from the sport and will forfeit that game no 

matter what the final score is. Managers are responsible for their player’s eligibility. Ignorance is no excuse. You 
have been warned.</b><br><br> 

B. No alumni or graduate students are allowed to participate in IFC sports, but are encouraged to attend to provide 
support.  (Approved Fall 1999)<br> 
          1. Associate members, candidates, novices, or pledges may participate in IFC sports if  
          proper notice of their candidacy or pledgeship has been given to both the Greek Advisor,   
          via the scholarship report and the IFC Vice President of Rush.  Also they must comply   
          with university eligibility policies.<br><br> 
C. New members that have already played for a different team may not participate in an IFC major sport until next 
quarter.  Those members who have played in IFC and are no longer affiliated with an IFC chapter may not join 
another Campus Recreation team (Approved Fall 2004). <br><br>
D. ALL IFC sports eligibility violations will be reported to IFC Judicial Board and be held under IFC Judicial Board 
bylaws for further sanctioning (Approved Fall 2004). <br><br> 
E. Teams playing with ineligible players will forfeit the game played by this person and receive a sportsmanship rating 
of an one (1). That player will be banned from further participation for the remainder of the quarter (Approved 
Winter 2007).</p>

<!-- End Section Handbook -->
   <div id="article_4">
     <p>A. <b> Major sport points</b> will consist of a culmination of League results, IFC playoffs, All University playoffs, and 
attendance at the Sports Meetings.<br> 
1. League points start at 50 points for first place, 40 points for second, and will decrease by increments of 10.<br> 
       a. In the event of a tie, the points for the position and the succeeding positions will be added up and divided 
equally among the tied teams.  I.E., two teams are tied for third place, then the third and fourth place points 
would be added and then divided by two.  The next team would then receive the fifth place points.<br> 
       b. When leagues play “interleague” (due to scheduling problems) competition, the top two records (from both 
leagues) will earn 50 points; next two earn 40, and so on. <b>(Approved Spring, 1999)</b><br> 
       c. In leagues of two different sizes (e.g. a 5 team league and a 4 team league), in which no interleague occurs, 
points will be separated.  Thus each league champion receives 50 points, etc. The 5th  place team in the one
league still receives 10 points. <b>(Approved Spring, 1999)</b><br>
d. For 10 team leagues (i.e. two leagues of 5) in the ARC, each team will play one interleague game to avoid 
‘bye’ weeks.  This gives each team an extra game.  Interleague match-ups are done by random draw.  Such 
games count in all league standings. <b>(Approved Fall, 1999)</b><br>   
2. The IFC playoffs will be worth 60 points for first place, 40 points for second, and will decrease in increments of 
ten points per place. (ie, 40, 30, 20...)<br>
3. All University points will serve as a bonus set of points.  These will only be awarded to a team which can place 
in the top three positions.  A bonus of 15 points will be awarded for first, 10 for second, and 5 points for third. 
<b>(Approved, 6/2/97).</b><br>
4. Attendance at the monthly sports meetings will count as five points per meeting.<br>
5. Manager’s meeting for major and minor sport: Mandatory for every chapter: Each chapter receives 5 points for 
attending each major and minor sport manager’s meeting. For chapters who do not attend the meeting they will 
lose 5 points. <b>(Approved Winter 2010)</b><br>
6. At any time during the season, if any player is ejected from the game (major sport or minor sport) the chapter 
will lose 15 IFC points. <b>(Approved Winter 2010)</b><br> 
7. During the season if the same chapter is involved resulting in a second ejection by the same or different player, 
the chapter will be removed from the league.<br>
8. If three or more different chapters are involved in an altercation resulting in an ejection in that sport, the entire 
league is cancelled. No points earned will be given. <b>(Approved Winter 2010)</b><br> 
9. During playoffs if a player is ejected that chapter will lose 30 points and the chapter will be disqualified from 
IFC and ALL U playoffs. IFC Points earned will not be affected.  <b>(Approved Winter 2010)</b><br> 
10.Disqualification from a sport will result in a loss and possible further sanctions from the Department of 
Intramural Sports.<br>
11.In the case of an appeal, it must go through an appeal board consisting of the IFC Executive board and the Greek 
Advisor, it must receive approval by the IFC.<br><br> 
B.<b>Minor sport points</b> will start at 65 points for first place, 50 points for second, and will decrease in increments of 10 
points.<br>
1. A forfeit in the first round of a single elimination tournament, i.e. ultimate frisbee, will result in the forfeiting 
team receiving zero points for that sport.<br> 
2. A fraternity can earn IFC points if they participate with the minimum number required to be in the sport.  For 
example, wrestling requires one participant, and team tennis requires four.  Still, a team must pay the team entry 
fee to register as a participating IFC team.  Note:  To win the Campus Recreation team, the team must fulfill the 
minimum team number required.  Thus, wrestling, track, and swim require four participants.<br> 
3. At least four IFC teams must participate in a minor sport for that event to qualify towards IFC points.</p>

any IFC sport are ineligible to play that IFC sport for the remainder of the season. However they may be 
allowed to participate in the All University but will not count towards IFC points. <br> 
B. Any chapter who is found guilty in the middle of the season and is suspended from IFC Intramurals shall finish 
the season and start their suspension in the following quarter. Teams that are suspended may participate in any 
of the Minor sports but will not count towards IFC points.<br>  
C. Any Fraternity that is absent at two games per season within the same sport, without notification to the Director 
of Intramural Sports, IFC VP Programming, and/or the opposing team, shall be disqualified for the remainder 
of the season.  The sports dues shall not be refunded as well for that particular season.<br> 
D. The IFC council must inform the Intramural Director, in writing, if any IFC chapter is suspended for more than 
a quarter due to violations in IFC rules and policies that govern them.  </p>
